[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-IIS201)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-IIS201)

## Description

This hands-on session gives you an opportunity to transform screens in the classic SAP GUI interface into simple, role-based, adaptive designs using the SAP Fiori user experience without extensive coding. This session presents how to use SAP Screen Personas software to make complex SAP GUI screens more intuitive. This proven approach improves user productivity, reduces training time, and increases data quality with minimal load on your IT team.

## Requirements

Participants should be familiar with using SAP GUI to perform transactions in an SAP ERP system. You should be comfortable navigating between transactions and switching between screens and tabs within a single transaction. For scripting, some JavaScript knowledge will be helpful, but not essential; we’ll give you the information you need to complete the exercises. 

## Exercises

**The exercise content and the system access details are available [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-IIS201/blob/main/TechEd2020_IIS201_Workbook.pdf).**

The source code of the SAPUI5 Fiori Table featured in the exercises can be seen [here](https://github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-IIS201/tree/main/samples/iw29-mobile-table)  

If you have a chance, we recommend using two screens. One should display the workbook you downloaded locally, so you can easily zoom in or out as necessary, to see all details. The other screen is to perform the actual hands-on tasks. This arrangement significantly improves your experience, instead of having to switch between windows on a single, small screen.

## How to obtain support

Support for the content in this repository is available during the actual time of the online session for which this content has been designed. Otherwise, you may request support via the [Issues](../../issues) tab.
